# 🕒 JavaScript Clock

A simple, real-time analog and digital clock built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
Created as part of my Full-Stack Development Master Program while following a guided tutorial.

## 📌 About the Project

This project was developed as an exercise to strengthen my foundational front-end development skills. It helped me reinforce my understanding of:

- DOM manipulation in JavaScript
- CSS transformations and animations
- Real-time JavaScript functions using `setInterval`
- Structuring clean and readable code

The goal was to reproduce a working, animated clock that shows both analog and digital time using only native web technologies — without any libraries or frameworks.

## 🎯 Purpose

As an aspiring full-stack developer, I’m currently building a series of projects to solidify both my front-end and back-end skills. This clock project represents a small but important step in my journey toward becoming proficient in interactive UI development and clean code practices.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Transforms)
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## 🚀 Features

- Live updating time
- Smooth animation of clock hands
- Responsive layout

## 📚 What I Learned

- How to calculate angles for clock hands based on time
- How to update the DOM dynamically and continuously
- The importance of clean code structure, naming, and modular thinking


## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

I’m a full-stack developer in training, passionate about clean, accessible, and functional design. I’m currently building a portfolio of small but purposeful projects like this one to demonstrate my learning journey.
